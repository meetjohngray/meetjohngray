I am a change maker who loves learning and making the world better through the innovative use of technology and empowering people to be their best self. My 20 years of experience in a variety of roles at Outward Bound has taught me how to manage the logistical and human resources necessary to bring projects to fruition. I am a leader who also knows best when it is time to follow.
